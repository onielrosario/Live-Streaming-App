- user can play/pause, seek, and display current time/duration of the video.

## Requirements:
- [x] Minimal Application. 
- [x] Allows a user to select a source from a list view and playback HLS content. 
- [x] A detail view using the AVPlayer. 
- [x] Written in swift.
- [x] MVVM architecture. 
- [x] The player shall have a custom control bar with the ability to play/pause, seek, and display current time/duration.
- [x] Video only allows landscape mode.

## List of features I could improve:
- Custom designs for launch page
- Custom logo for the app
- Copyright infrightment statements to allow the app to be deployed in the App Store.
The app uses open source HLS contents. [you can view them found here](https://github.com/bengarney/list-of-streams/blob/master/README.md)

- Custom playback controls. Got to work on some of it on another branch:
